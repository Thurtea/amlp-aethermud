# Progress Assessment

Component | Files | Completed | Partial | Stub
---|---:|---:|---:|---:
Driver Core | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1
Compiler | 9 | 6 | 3 | 0
Networking | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0
Game Systems | 11 | 6 | 5 | 0
LPC Library | 623 | 41 | 354 | 228

## Critical Gaps
- Auto-detected TODOs and small files indicate partial or stub implementations.


## Next Development Priorities
- Stabilize driver core and networking; finish compiler components; expand llm integration coverage.
