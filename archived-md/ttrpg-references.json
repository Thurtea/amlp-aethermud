Even\n      though all creatures have a certain level of potential psychic energy\n      (P.P.E.), the psi-stalker can tell the subtle differences between normal\n      energies and psychic and magic energies.

This psychic inner self is the astral body, a whitish, transparent,\n      ghostly image of the character's physical form. A long silver thread or\n      cord connects the astral body with its physical self. If the cord is severed\n      the character is likely to die of sudden shock as body and soul are torn\n      asunder. There is only a 30% chance the astral self can locate its physical\n      body without the silver umbilical cord (roll best 2 out of 3).\n         The physical body lapses into a coma-like trance when the astral self\n      has left it. In this state the body is completely helpless. It can not walk,\n      move or think; completely catatonic.\n         The hazards are threefold. First, if the physical body is killed, the\n      astral body is forever lost and will die, fade away, within six hours.\n      Second, if the astral body gets lost or captured while in the astral plane,\n      the body will begin to waste away and die. (Note:One minute of our\n      time is equal to one week in the astral plane). Third, the astral body\n      is vulnerable to psychic attacks and attacks from ghosts, entities and\n      creatures of the astral plane.\n         There are two levels of astral projection, coexistence (physical body\n      and spirit form) in the material world and/or the astral plane (another\n      dimension). Astral projection from the physical body into the material\n      world creates a ghostly specter of the astral self which can be seen only\n      by other psychics, young children under 13 years old, animals and most\n      supernatural creatures. While in astral form the character automatically\n      gains the ability to float, fly (mach one/670mph maximum), see the\n      invisible, pass through solid objects, impervious to physical harm (in-\n      cluding cold, heat and energy), and see and hear as usual. The astral\n      body can not communicate with the physical world except through\n      telepathy or empathy, nor speak to, smell or touch anything on the\n      material plane. The astral self is little more than a mute, ghostly ob-\n      server. Of course, this is a great way to locate invisible supernatural\n      entities, as well as spy on other humans on the material plane (although\n      limited by short sprints. See duration).",

In that fateful confrontation, the great Dunscon had\nbeen wounded and was being swept away to a safe place by loyal\nsupporters. They were pursued by Chi-Town troops lead by a young\nGeneral named Joseph Prosek. As they tell the story, General Prosek's\nforces slaughtered Nostrous' protectors and the General, himself, killed\nthe unconscious, helpless, Nostrous. General Prosek then lead a two\nyear campaign of genocide that was thought to have been successful\nin obliterating all members of the Federation of Magic (and 13,000\ninnocent people suspected of using magic or of being Federation sym-\npathizers). This would establish Chi-Town as the reigning power in the\nland and catapult Joseph Prosek to the position of heroic leader of\nChi-Town. After Joseph's death, his son, Karl Prosek, would become\nthe chairman-elect of Chi-Town. Karl would build on the political\nfoundation his father had established, preying on the people's fears of\nmagic and the supernatural. He would build an army without equal,\ncreate the Coalition States, and proclaim himself Emperor Karl Prosek,\nthe First. As one might suspect, Alistair Dunscon despises the Prosek\nfamily and the Coalition.",

The net effect is to give the\n   character the ability to go without breathing for up to two hours.\n   Note that the character must breathe normally for about three hours\n   to fully recharge the cell between uses. The lung also has a gas\n   filtration system designed to filter most toxic gases out of the system\n   before they can do damage.

The\n   translator is fluent in the nine or so major known languages and can\n   be programmed, by a technician, to add six others.\n      The audio translations are transmitted to the cybernetic ear/head-\n  jack and is loud enough for only the borg to hear it. The system\n   also has a limited recording capability. The borg can activate the\n   recorder by a simple jaw movement. Maximum recording time is\n   one hour and the recording disc can be re-used over again and again,\n   with minimal audio distortion. The recording can be secretly played\n  back in the ear of the borg or transmitted over the jaw radio or\n   loudspeaker if available. Translations can also be transmitted over\n   the loudspeaker.\n   Cost: 11,000 credits.\nMolecular Analyzer: This microchip based sensor is used for testing\n  and analyzing impurities in the air. It can specifically identify any\n  chemical, or strange and dangerous molecules, like the presence of\n  gas, oil, pollution, or other chemicals in the air.
