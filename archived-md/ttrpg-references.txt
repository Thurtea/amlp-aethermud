  Recovery: Nonprofessional treatment. This is basic, first aid-type
treatment by oneself, or non-medically trained people. This type of
treatment may be used if the character is not able to seek professional
treatment immediately. It is not necessarily inferior treatment, especially
for a not too serious ailment, but just lacks the full facilities and experi-
ence of a major medical institution. Rate of Recovery: Two hit points
per day (24 hours) and/or 4 S.D.C. points per day.
   Recovery: Professional treatment. This is medical treatment from
a doctor, clinic, hospital, or psychic healer. Rate of Recovery: Two
hit points per day for the first two days, and four hit points per day for
each following day, until the character has regained all his/her original
hit points. S.D.C. points are restored at a rate of 6 per day.
Surviving Coma And Death
   When a character's hit points are reduced to zero (or less), he/she
collapses, lapsing into a coma. This character is near death, and will
die in a matter of hours unless he/she receives immediate medical
treatment.

 Player Characters in
 the World of Rifts
    It is odd to me that players often seem, to miss the fact that they are
 playing larger than life heroes in a fantastic world whenever they play
 any role-playing game. Rifts is no different.
    The typical person in Rifts is a farmer, mechanic, merchant, grunt,
 or other hard working individual trying to survive in a world gone mad.
 The average person is not likely to have psionics nor mega-damage
 weapons and armor. He is not a master of magic nor holder of great
 truths. He is one of the ordinary folk who live and struggle with the
 day to day hardships of life.
    The masses are the present and future of mankind. They are the
 innocent and the hopeful who will directly and indirectly motivate the
 actions of our heroes' adventures and heroics. As such, they are also,
 often, the victims and the prize in the never ending power struggles
 between the forces which seek to dominate this strange, future Earth.
   The player characters in Rifts are not Joe Average. For whatever
 reason, they have attained knowledge and/or power that has set them
apart from the norm. They have become the focus in a small and
continuing drama within a much larger story. They are the men and
women who can make a difference. The individuals who dare to question
what they see and hear. They are the strong who step out of the crowd
to protect the weak. They are champions of ideas and ideals. They are
individuals who dare to dream and are willing to fight to attain that
dream. Individuals who step out of the shadows of reality and into the
realm of legend.
   The origins of the heroes may be modest and ordinary. They may,                 by the unflattering titles of mercenary, rogue, or sorcerer, but they are
at first, seem as typical as anybody else. Their motivations may be                heroes nonetheless, like wandering samurai of old.
selfish or born out of desperation. Their heroics may be deliberate or
they may stumble into greatness, but ultimately, they rise above the
ordinary and make their mark on the land, and perhaps the pages of
history. These are the heroes. This is their story ... and you are the
architect of that story.

AIMED
   An aimed shot means a person takes the time to carefully aim and
squeeze off one, well placed shot. Each individual shot takes one full
attack. Thus, if a character has four attacks per melee he/she can shoot
FOUR aimed shots. This applies to all weapons. Roll to strike for each
shot.
Bonus to Strike is +4 with a revolver or +3 for all others.
BURST
   A burst is the shooting of several rounds, immediately one after
another. Aim is more hasty and the recoil moves the weapon with each
shot, reducing the accuracy. Semiautomatic/automatic weapons,
machineguns and sub-machine guns, are designed for burst firing. The
concept is that, while accuracy is reduced, the odds of hitting one's
target with multiple rounds is increased because more shots are fired.
Bonus to Strike is + 1 with all weapons.
Note: Roll to strike once to see if the entire burst hits. Do not roll for
each individual bullet. If the burst misses its target, then all the rounds
in that burst miss.                                                                Short burst spray: 10% of rounds/magazine; inflicts normal damage

Full Bionic Conversion
   Full bionic conversion means that the character is over 90% machine.
The entire body has been replaced with a mechanical one. The remaining
human parts are restricted to the brain, often, but not always, the face,
and a few other original human components, especially the tongue,
throat, and head. The rest of the body has been discarded and the few
human components kept are placed in a bionic body. The body is
effectively a fully functioning robot that responds to the human brain
with the precision of the flesh and blood body. The internal workings
of the new body systems are strangely similar to the human body with
scores of tubing carrying life sustaining fluids. Electro-magnetic relays
and nano-technological workings make up the rest of the internal system.
The new body is hundreds of times more durable, faster, stronger, and
deadlier.
   Full conversion for military purposes means the best optic systems,
hearing, headjack, and weapons. Physical capabilities are generally
taken near the maximum, and the mechanized warrior is out fitted with
five bionic weapons.
   Full conversion for slave labor means the subject has basic or
minimum optical enhancement and no weapons or other sensory en-
hancement (unless it specifically relates to the labor).
Psionics and P.P.E.: A person who possesses psionics will retain his
    psi-powers only in the case of a partial bionic reconstruction and
    even then, I.S.P. is permanently reduced by half. Full conversion
    destroys all psionic essence. Scientists do not understand why this
    is, but speculate that the psionic essence is somehow linked to the
    physical body, as well as to the mind.
       Likewise, no borg, partial or full, can operate techno-wizardry
    devices nor practice magic. However, borgs do enjoy a bonus to
    save versus magic of + 3 and are impervious to psionic bio-manipu-
    lation and see aura. P.P.E.: Virtually nonexistent, 1D4.

 he or she may have been before the conversion. Most slave-borgs are
 simple people with few formal skills and little or no education.

 The Coalition Soldiers
  What follows are the major types of Coalition State military O.C.C.s.
The basic indoctrination for each are nearly identical, only the attribute
requirements and specific areas of training (MOS) vary. All have access
to CS power armor, robots, vehicles, and weapons. Equipment is pro-
vided on an as needed basis. Depending on rank and the circumstances,
the character can easily acquire energy weapons, ammunition, vehicles
and armor by simply requesting them from his commanding officer. A
good rapport with one's chain of command can be an important factor
in getting properly outfitted for one's assignment.

Coalition Soldiers as player characters
   As I hope I have pointed out, the Coalition soldier is not innately
evil and can make an exciting and fun addition to any group of players.
The soldier can freely associate with characters who might otherwise
be considered criminals of the State, if he or she is assigned to recon-
naissance, spying, observation, or exploration of the wilderness and
wastelands.
  This is acceptable for two reasons: One, if the characters are outside
Coalition territory, they are not under CS jurisdiction and can live by
their own "twisted" laws and morals. The soldier can live and work
with these heathens, but is told to try to maintain his ethics and do not
accept these creatures as equals or friends. Secondly, it is crucial for
the Coalition to know what these rogues and the other wilderness people
are doing. Thus, the soldier must tolerate their sinister or foolhardy
behavior to learn important data that will preserve the CS.
  Unfortunately, many soldiers assigned to the outback come to see
these other people as friends and allies. The soldier may even learn
other values and reject the years of propaganda. This too is okay as
long as he keeps his feelings to himself. If the Coalition learns of the
warrior's skewed views, he could be branded a traitor.

Soldiers gone bad
  Inevitably, soldiers who are regularly assigned to the down side,
wastelands, wilderness, and long-term exploratory missions, find their
view of the world changing. Often that view contradicts the edicts of
the Coalition. The officers of the Coalition States' Armed Forces are
surprisingly tolerant of eccentric behavior and individualistic modes of
expression and operation, as long as it serves to further the Coalition's
needs. Savagery against mutoids, D-Bees, Auto-Gs, aliens, demons,                 Coalition Grunt O.C.C.

   If the roll fails, roll to determine which personality surfaces to take
   control. Once the personality is aware that a psionic probe is being
   used to suppress him and bring out a different personality, he gets
   a +4 to save vs psionics and is likely to attack the psionic. If he
   fails to make the savings throw, there is a 65% chance of pulling
   forth the specific personality desired.
5. Hypnotic Suggestion (psionic): Has a small chance of being used
   to pull out a specific personality (30%). The current personality
   automatically gets a +3 to save vs psionic attack when hypnotic
   suggestion is being used.

DETERMINING RANDOM CONTROL
   Determining which personality takes random control is easy. If you
have TWO personalities, 1-3 represents the dominant personality, 4-6
the other, secondary, personality. THREE personalities: 1-2 is the do-
minant, 3-4 a secondary personality, 5-6 the other. FOUR personalities:
1-3 represents the dominant, 3, 4, 5 and 6 each represents one of the
secondary personalities. FIVE personalities: 1-2 the dominant, 3, 4, 5
& 6 each represents one of the other personalities. SIX personalities
#1 is the dominant, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 each represent one of the other
personalities. Assign a numerical designation to each personality and
roll a six-sided die to determine which one is in control.

    The average Glitter Boy is a career soldier who finds combat a thrill
They often wander the land in search of gainful employment or a good
cause to fight for As a mercenary, the soldier can solicit excellent
wages, just under those of a Crazy As a champion of a good cause,
they will fight for little or no pay, enjoying the satisfaction of the deed
Some of the older or married warriors have settled down and become
the protectors or rulers of small wilderness communities, but even a
semi-retired GB will laugh at the specter of death and leap into a fight
if the pay or the cause is right However, they are not nearly as impetuous
nor suicidal as Juicers or Crazies
    Glitter Boys are more akin to mercenary cyber-knights Like the
cyber-knight, most Glitter Boys have seen many atrocities for many
reasons Consequently, while some may have their prejudices, most
are fairly tolerant of non-humans and open to most other life styles
They do not hate or fear psychics, practitioners of magic, D-Bees, or
mutoids, and will welcome them as equals Of course, these seasoned
veterans are nobody's fool, and look upon all strangers with suspicion
until they have proven themselves trustworthy Also like the cyber-
knight, Glitter Boys tend to be wandering adventurers always in search
of excitement
    While a few Glitter Boys are frequently found among bands of other
warriors, they seldom organize into troops entirely composed of Glitter
Boys This may be a conscious tactic, for while the robot armor is
incredibly powerful, it is also comparatively slow and earthbound

Juicer O.C.C.
   In man's search to create the ultimate human, it was inevitable that,
sooner or later, someone turned to chemical enhancement.
   The creation of the chemical man came from Eastern Europe, where
was seen the rise of the super athlete/warrior. At first, drugs were used
to build the natural body through the use of synthetic hormones, such
as steroids to build muscles, and EPO to increase blood flow and
physical performance. However, it soon became apparent that the chem-
ical condition was too difficult to maintain at peak level over long
periods of time. Unless the individual was carefully monitored and drug
intake adjusted, the person would experience severe performance drop-
offs, lulls, and highs. A consistent level of optimum performance was
necessary in order to create the perfect human super-machine.




   New designer drugs were combined with a computerized biological
monitoring and drug dispensary system with incredible results. The
computer system monitored every aspect of the body: blood flow, air
intake, oxygen levels, adrenaline release, sugar levels, hormone levels,
respiration, neurological responses and stimuli, digestion, and other
aspects of the functioning human body. Microscopic implants placed
in the vascular system, brain, and muscles mapped out the body in
unimaginable detail. Nano-technology and chemical advancement
would herald the day of the super-human without the extreme mechanical
augmentation of bionics.
   The first step in creating the chemical super man is the implantation
of two tiny mega-computers called the bio-comp system. The postage
stamp sized devices are implanted in the subject's head and/or chest.
The dual system served as a fail-safe feature that enables one bio-comp
system to override the other in case of malfunction. Only one system
operates at a time, although both are neurologically linked to hundreds
of microscopic sensors implanted throughout the body. These tiny im-
plants constantly relay data about the subject's physiology as the body
reacts and changes in response to stimuli like drugs, stress, pain, and
combat. The bio-comp system is also designed to trigger different natural
and artificial chemical responses to thousands of specific conditions.
For example: If the body needs a jolt of adrenaline, the bio-comp system
triggers a microscopic implant to release it precisely when needed. If
it needs more than the natural amount of adrenaline, the system sees
to it that more is delivered. If the body is feeling fatigued, a form of
super EPO synthetic hormone is injected to increase the oxygen flow
into the blood, which decreases fatigue and increases physical perfor-
mance by an amazing 16 to 21 percent! Other sensors, implants and
chemicals are utilized to negate pain, clot blood, and stimulate chemical
reactions.
   An injection collar around the neck, wrists, upper arm, and legs,
deliver the needed synthetic chemicals. The man-made drugs are con-
tained in a soft, padded harness worn under clothing and battle armor.
Tubes run from the central dispensary system of the harness to the
specific injection collars. This is especially useful in the immediate
treatment of specific areas of the body, especially for pain and muscular
disorders.
   In addition to initiating or countering specified chemical reactions,
the bio-comp system also maintains the body at maximum levels of
efficiency. All aspects of optimum physical conditioning are monitored
and maintained. The individual's body weight, calorie intake, breathing,
muscles, bulk, flexibility, reflexes, alertness, vision, and sensitivity
are all maintained on a constant basis.

the new O.C.C., at which point the old skills continue to increase per
level of experience thereafter.
   3. The price of drugs. Penalties!
   First, all the Juicer bonuses and powers are permanently gone! The
character must be effectively rebuilt and will never come close to his
former life as a Juicer.
   Second, reduce all physical attributes to eight (8) regardless of
bonuses from previously selected physical skills, then add the roll of
1D4 to each. These are the character's new physical attributes. To the
ex-juicer, this is a nightmare. Reflexes and speed will seem like a
snail's and strength like a baby's. Such is the price of drug abuse.
   Third, the character looks 10 years older than he really is for every
one year as a juicer. Also reduce P.B. attribute by 1D4.
   Fourth, S.D.C. is reduced to 5D6. Hit Points are P.E. plus 1D6 per                   JUICER

   Fifth, poor reaction time and reflexes. Remember, all the Juicer's

 City Rat O.C.C.
    The city rat is one of the denizens of the city's who lives in its lower
 levels, tunnels, and sewers. Most have never been beyond the city walls
 and view the outside world as wondrous, scary, and alien. Their world
 is the dark city streets, crowded with people, garbage, vehicles, and
 vermin. They know the back streets, and often the sewers and access
 tunnels, like most know the highways and avenues. They can spot a
 drug dealer from a 1000 feet away and know the advantages and dangers
 offered by the cyber-doc.


    Those who live in the lower levels of a city are generally nicknamed
 "Down Siders," but the city rat is a designation for a Down Sider
 troublemaker. Rats are usually young men and women in their teens
 or 20's who walk on the wild side. They crave adventure and find it
 by bucking the system. A city rat may be an idealistic rebel who seeks
 reform and justice in a corrupt and unjust society like that of the Coal-
 ition, or he may be a computer hacker, beggar, thief, or gangland thug.

           The process of a link to a supernatural being begins with com-
        municating with it through a rift. A small dimensional portal/rift is
        created at a ley line nexus point. The shifter then speaks to the force
        which responds usually via telepathy. The two strike up a deal in
        which the supernatural intelligence agrees to link with the character
        and bestow great power upon him. Often there is a condition attached
        to this dangerous union, such as securing a particular device or item,
        or to hurt or kill somebody, usually another shifter who is linked
        to a rival force or someone who is interfering with the intelligence's
       plans/games. If the shifter agrees, the alien/supernatural force pro-
       jects a portion of its psychic essence into the shifter. This gives the
       mage great power, as will be described shortly, but it also gives the
        supernatural force a link to our world.
           The link to a supernatural force is not quite the same as the animal
       familiar link. In this case, the shifter may be thought of as the
       familiar servant. Most shifters make the mistake of believing that
       they can control the supernatural force, even if it is evil, and use
       their powers for good. Unfortunately, the supernatural intelligence
       is a great and cunning force that often uses the shifter as its pawn
       in a game where humans/mortals are its playing pieces and the Earth,
       its game board. The force can often manipulate the shifter into
       helping it win its game. For example: The creature may agree to
       link and empower the mage if he agrees to destroy a particular
       person or place. In all likelihood, the person or place is one of evil
       and its destruction will make the world a safer and nicer place, so
       the shifter agrees. However, what he or she does not know, is that
       the target for destruction is the pawn of a rival force or somebody
       who is jeopardizing the creature's own evil plans, so it wants the
       target eliminated.
           The shifter can usually communicate with the supernatural force
        by opening a tiny communication rift at a nexus point to his dimension
        and speak into the rift. Here the fiend can counsel and advise its
        foolish human pawn. Often its advice will be good, but this only
        to lure the mage into a false sense of security and trust. Once it has
        established a relationship of trust, it can abuse that trust by giving
        the shifter bad advice or mislead him. Note: These supernatural
        intelligences are not omnipotent, as some pretend, but make evalu-
        ations and decisions based on information which it has gathered.
           The most powerful of these creatures will claim to be gods and
        demon lords and may establish a group or cult of followers/pawns.
        In some cases, the vile intelligence may even pretend to be a couple
        different entities and create two or three very different, sometimes
        rival, groups of humanoid pawns. This is all just part of its game
        to amuse itself. Note that these most powerful supernatural beings
        can link with a score of individuals at the same time without the
        others knowing it.
            Perhaps worst of all, is that the link with the shifter gives the
        monster a connection to our own dimension. Without this connection,
        the creature can not enter into our world, but the physical link to
        our planet, through the shifter, means that it can now rift into Earth.
        Fortunately, these greater beings usually remain in their own dimen-
        sion, where they are safest (the creature can only be killed if it
        comes into the Earth dimension or if an enemy goes into its dimen-
        sion).
           The abilities gained by a link with the supernatural are as
        follows:
           Additional 1D6x10 P.P.E., additional 1D4 x 10 physical
        S.D.C., additional +3 to save vs horror factor, +2 to save vs
        magic and psionic attacks, and +1 on initiative rolls. Also the
        shifter will be granted his choice of six additional magic spells
        selected from magic levels 6-14. ——————————————————

    ing in magic that limits the techno-wizard's spell casting abilities,
    but his orientation. That orientation is magic used in conjunction
    with machines. Consequently, his spell casting abilities are not the
    same as other spell casters. Spell Casting Penalty: All spell ranges,
    durations, M.D.C./S.D.C. and damage are half when cast as a spell
    or ritual rather than channeled through a TW device.
      A techno-wizard is primarily interested in energy spells needed
   to power mystic devices. The wizard spends much of his time build-
   ing and tinkering with new devices rather than seeking out new
   spells.
      At level one experience, the character knows the following spells
   fundamental to his needs for empowering TW devices! Blinding
   flash, globe of day light, ignite fire, fuel flame, fire bolt, call light-
   ning, energy bolt, energy field, impervious to energy, and tele-
   kinesis.
      At third level a total of three additional spells can be selected
   from magic levels 1-4.
      Note: Other spells can be used to create other devices. For exam-
   ple: Superior invisibility can be used to create a vehicle or suit that
   can turn invisible.
2. Learning new spells. Additional spells and rituals of any magic
   level can be learned and or purchased at any time regardless of the
   wizard's experience level. The techno-wizard's area of interest will
   first be in energy spells, followed by physical manipulation that can
   be applied to devices, such as invisibility, armor of I than, fly,
   talisman, teleport, dimensional portal, and related. The character is
   not usually interested in other areas of magic and never acquires
   summoning or circle magic.
3. Magic Bonuses. + 2 to save versus horror factor. +1 to save
   versus magic at levels three, seven, ten, and thirteen. + 1 to spell
   strength (the number others must save against when you cast a spell)
   at levels four, eight, and twelve.
4. P.P.E.:Like all men of magic, the techno-wizard is a living battery
   of mystic energy that he can draw on to create magic. Permanent
   Base P.P.E: 2D4x 10, in addition to the P.E. attribute number.
   Add 2D6 P.P.E. per each additional level of experience. Of course,
   the mage can also draw P.P.E. from ley lines, nexus points, and
   other people whenever available.

Attribute Requirements: l.Q. 12, M.E. 12 or higher. A high P.E.

   Only practitioners of magic and psychics can use these techno-wizard
devices. To activate the magical power one must expend either magic
P.P.E. or psionic I.S.P. The cost in potential psychic energy (raw
magic) is always less than psionic inner strength.
   The Initial Creation Cost is the amount of P.P.E. required for the
techno-wizard to instill the magic ability in the item/mechanism. There
will always be some sort of addition to the device that symbolizes the
added mystic power. For example: a suit of armor that has the breathe
without air ability is likely to have an air tank and/or oxygen mask or
helmet built into it. If that item is removed or destroyed, that techno-
wizard power is lost. Impervious to fire may mean the armor is red in
color and has some additional gadget attached to it. And so on.
   The Cost indicates what the average price for such a magical addition
will be on the black market! Remember, these items are fairly uncommon
and can only be used by men of magic and psychics. Magic items are
illegal in all Coalition States. Possession of magic in CS territory is a
serious offense, punishable by 10 years imprisonment for each item
found in one's possession. Magic dealers are usually subjected to a
humiliating public trail and executed!

         who prefers to use his or her powers and courage rather than skills
         or machines.
            At first level the psychic can speak American and one other
         language at 90% proficiency, selects two piloting skills (both with
         a + 10% bonus), and can select six "other" skills, each with a 10%
         bonus. The only combat skill is Hand to Hand: Basic. Hand to Hand:
         Basic can be changed to Hand to Hand: Expert at the cost of one
         "other" skill, or Martial Arts (or assassin if an evil alignment) for
         the cost of two "other" skills.
             The character can also select eight (8) Secondary skills without
         benefit of bonuses. At third and eighth levels an additional four
          secondary skills can be selected.

      Psi-Stalker R.C.C.
         The Psi-stalker is a mutant whose psychic sensitive powers enable
      him to sense other psychics, psychic energy, and magic. The character
      can be human, or a D-Bee, or a mutoid. Unlike normal humans, the
      psi-stalker is a natural predator and P.P.E. vampire! The predator senses
      the use of psychic energy (I.S.P. and P.P.E.) and can follow the distinc-
      tive energy trail like a bloodhound following a specific scent. Even
      though all creatures have a certain level of potential psychic energy
      (P.P.E.), the psi-stalker can tell the subtle differences between normal
      energies and psychic and magic energies. Some innate instinct draws
      the stalker to those creatures who are psionic or magic. This same
      instinct makes the mutant want to kill his prey and drink its P.P.E.
      (which, for a brief instant, doubles when the victim dies). Fortunately,
      psi-stalkers can train themselves not to kill, although they prefer to kill
      and feed, and love the thrill of the hunt!
         The Coalition States (CS) have trained people with the psi-stalker
      instincts and abilities to become an elite military police force, special-
      izing in hunting down psychic and magic criminals, supernatural beings,
      and paranormal interlopers. In addition to the stalker's natural abilities,
      the warriors are trained in basic military procedure and combat skills.

   stalkers, is to hunt and kill one's victim. The victim can be a

   absorb the energy of his kill from as far as 300 yards/meters.
      No need for normal food or water. The P.P.E. energy vampires
   have little need to consume solid food or drink water. The mutant
   does not require more than one pound (0.45 kg) of meat and eight
   ounces of water a week to remain healthy. Furthermore, the psychic
   can go without food or water for up to three weeks, if necessary,
   without ill effect. However, being deprived of the proper P.P.E.
   energy will inflict physical damage and the character will die of
   starvation within three weeks.
7. Other Psionic Powers: Choose six psi-powers from the Sensitive
   category of powers.
8. Psionic empathy with animals. Psi-stalkers automatically have
   an affinity with animals of all kinds. Domesticated animals will
   always take an immediate liking to a stalker and will do their best
   to please him; +15% bonus to ride a horse and work with all
   domestic animals.
      Wild animals, with the exception of felines and mutant and alien
   predators, will react to the stalker as if he was a fellow woodland
   creature, allowing him to walk among them without fear. This
   ability enables psi-stalkers to operate in the wild without causing
   animals to react to their presence; birds do not fly away, animals
   do not run, and therefore do not indicate the approach of an intruder.
   Even watchdogs will not sound a bark of alarm at the presence of
   a stalker.
      Felines and mutant and alien predatory animals seem to see the
   psi-stalker as a fellow hunter and a danger. Wild cats and mutants
   will frequently select a psi-stalker as their first target in an attack
   and will not positively respond to the character at all.
      NOTE: This affinity with animals means that the character will
   hunt and eat meat only for food, never for pleasure, and feels
   sadness whenever he sees an animal in distress.

           Note: Telekinesis is not a force field, thus, while it can be used
        to parry/block a punch, kick, club, knife or even sword, it can not
        stop bullets, arrows, gas, flying tackles, and similar attacks. Further-
        more, a failed roll to telekinetically parry means the psychic did not
        parry and is struck by his opponent.

         Through intense concentration/meditation (4D4 minutes of prepara-
      tion) the psychic can free his mind, or inner self, from his physical
      body. This psychic inner self is the astral body, a whitish, transparent,
      ghostly image of the character's physical form. A long silver thread or
      cord connects the astral body with its physical self. If the cord is severed
      the character is likely to die of sudden shock as body and soul are torn
      asunder. There is only a 30% chance the astral self can locate its physical
      body without the silver umbilical cord (roll best 2 out of 3).
         The physical body lapses into a coma-like trance when the astral self
      has left it. In this state the body is completely helpless. It can not walk,
      move or think; completely catatonic.
         The hazards are threefold. First, if the physical body is killed, the
      astral body is forever lost and will die, fade away, within six hours.
      Second, if the astral body gets lost or captured while in the astral plane,
      the body will begin to waste away and die. (Note:One minute of our
      time is equal to one week in the astral plane). Third, the astral body
      is vulnerable to psychic attacks and attacks from ghosts, entities and
      creatures of the astral plane.
         There are two levels of astral projection, coexistence (physical body
      and spirit form) in the material world and/or the astral plane (another
      dimension). Astral projection from the physical body into the material
      world creates a ghostly specter of the astral self which can be seen only
      by other psychics, young children under 13 years old, animals and most
      supernatural creatures. While in astral form the character automatically
      gains the ability to float, fly (mach one/670mph maximum), see the
      invisible, pass through solid objects, impervious to physical harm (in-
      cluding cold, heat and energy), and see and hear as usual. The astral
      body can not communicate with the physical world except through
      telepathy or empathy, nor speak to, smell or touch anything on the
      material plane. The astral self is little more than a mute, ghostly ob-
      server. Of course, this is a great way to locate invisible supernatural
      entities, as well as spy on other humans on the material plane (although
      limited by short sprints. See duration).

famous American Old West, like the western coastline, is wilderness.
The scenery is impressive and much different than the lush, green and
rolling hills of the east and northwest. Out here, the landscape is marked
by towering mountains, gaping canyons, vast deserts (all of Nevada is
desert), prairie grasslands, rolling, grass covered hills, and strange flora
and fauna. But there are also places of forest, especially near the moun-
tains.
    The ruins of ancient, pre-Rifts, cities are remarkably preserved. I
understand that as many as one in ten pre-Rifts cities still stand. They
are in ruin, but they have not yet crumbled into dust. The ruins are
often the sites of small human (and non-human) settlements. However,
there is nothing here that we would call civilization. It is a savage land

   6. Mexico. I've never been more than a few miles beyond the Rio
Grande so my knowledge is limited. I understand that the landscape is
more or less an extension of the American West, but turns into tropical
forest as one goes deep south. Mexico is populated by quiet peasant
communities of farmers. Certainly, there is no known industrial center
nor modem cities.
   Rumors abound of seething ley lines and kingdoms of vampires. I
have heard too many tales to completely rule out the horrible notion
that vampires rule old Mexico. We have all heard about roving gangs
of vampires that even plague the Coalition cities from time to time,
but this is even more disturbing. First, there are definitely barbaric
tribes of vampires who run wild in Mexico and Texas, especially along
the Rio Grande River. This is common knowledge to all who live in the
area. But now, stories emerge of a vampire empire located in the heart
of old Mexico. An empire composed of three great cities, each centered

   Levels three through one are the high security government levels.
The Chi-Town military, research facilities, and manufacturing
plants are all located in this vast lower bowl. Beyond this is the
Imperial Sanctum, several (I'm told five) subterranean levels that house
the Emperor, his family, military elite troops, generals and their
families, fantastic research and science facilities, bionics wing, indepen-
dent life support system and power plant, and the great, allegedly
destroyed, Chi-Town library. All subterranean levels are maximum
security areas restricted to the most powerful and elite members of the
CS and Chi-Town. I am told that the Imperial Sanctum is virtually
impervious to attack and could withstand a nuclear bombardment.
   The fabled Chi-Town Library is said to have been destroyed in a
titanic battle in 77 P.A., five years after Emperor Prosek rose to power.
It was reported that nothing survived. But this is a lie! The library still
exists as a secret source of lost history and technology for the Chi-town
Coalition. ALL OTHER BOOKS ARE FORBIDDEN!!!! The posses-

people. A plan that both he and his son (head of propaganda) have
executed masterfully.
   Chi-town is not built on the remains of Chicago, but exists miles
away. In fact, "Old Chicago" still stands in ruin. Much of it has been
completely destroyed, but portions of its skyscrapers and city-scape are
still present.
   The ruins of Old Chicago can be found some 80 miles northeast
of Chi-Town. The area is a forbidden zone with hundreds of warning

Juicers and Crazies, but this is forbidden by the Coalition and these
sections have been closed. Lone Star City has been expanded an addi-
tional 20 miles and has dozens of little peasant farm villages all around
it. The military complex is currently only operating at about 55% effi-
ciency (or so I am told), but is still the major producer of robots,
bionics, and weapons in the CS. Its most significant feature is the
phenomenal genetics research and mutation facilities, which accounts
for a full 30% of the entire complex. It was here that the first mutant
animals and, later, the Dog Packs were created.
   The city is governed by a council of scientists and engineers whose
forefathers first discovered and reclaimed the forgotten base. Their
primary concern is the pursuit of knowledge and the mastery of super-
technology. Consequently, they welcomed the opportunity to join the
Coalition States because their knowledge would help all of humankind
and because the CS would become their protectors, enabling them to
devote all of their time to research and development. The city council
seldom has any idea of what is happening beyond the boundaries of
the city. Regional governors, appointed by Chi-Town, deal with the
daily operations of the remaining territories in the Lone Star State.

true community of magic. In those days, thousands of mages lived and
worked together in Illinois and the Magic Zone. They even established
a thriving community in the ruins of Old Chicago. For a time, peace
and prosperity reigned, but soon, Nostrous and the other masters of
magic began to feel superior and a lust for power that grew into a
foolish plot to conquer the Americas. This ultimately lead to the Fed-
eration of Magic's assault on Chi-Town in the year 12 P.A. Despite
their magic powers, the Federation overestimated their own strength
and underestimated the ferocious opposition they would meet, especially
from Chi-Town.
    As the Federation of Magic tells the tale, after many months of battle,
the Chi-Town army had finally routed the last Federation stronghold
in Old Chicago. In that fateful confrontation, the great Dunscon had
been wounded and was being swept away to a safe place by loyal
supporters. They were pursued by Chi-Town troops lead by a young
General named Joseph Prosek. As they tell the story, General Prosek's
forces slaughtered Nostrous' protectors and the General, himself, killed
the unconscious, helpless, Nostrous. General Prosek then lead a two
year campaign of genocide that was thought to have been successful
in obliterating all members of the Federation of Magic (and 13,000
innocent people suspected of using magic or of being Federation sym-
pathizers). This would establish Chi-Town as the reigning power in the
land and catapult Joseph Prosek to the position of heroic leader of
Chi-Town. After Joseph's death, his son, Karl Prosek, would become
the chairman-elect of Chi-Town. Karl would build on the political
foundation his father had established, preying on the people's fears of
magic and the supernatural. He would build an army without equal,
create the Coalition States, and proclaim himself Emperor Karl Prosek,
the First. As one might suspect, Alistair Dunscon despises the Prosek
family and the Coalition.

now attaining its place as a potential power in the new Rifts World.

   22. Southern Michigan. Unlike its northern cousin, southern
Michigan, or the "Lower Peninsula," is a territory torn apart by the
rifts and mystic energy. It is rich with magic energy and dotted with
dozens of ley line nexus points and hundreds of ley lines, particularly
along the entire length of its eastern coast and the borders of what were
once Ohio and Indiana. It is here that the line walkers and mystics ride
the giant fury beetles, and creatures from the rifts dominate the land.
   Nexus points have been recorded by the Imperium and Lazlo at the
Pre-Rift cities of Alpena, Harrisville, Mikado, Tawas City, Standish,
Amelith, Bay City, Saginaw, Bad Axe, Palms, Lapeer, Croswell,
St.Clair, Pontiac, Farmington, Detroit, Monroe, Adrian, Jackson, Battle
Creek, Kalamazoo, Cassopolis, and Niles. As well as at neighboring
Toledo, Ohio and Angola, and South Bend, Indiana.
   Several feudal kingdoms of magic and/or psychics, as well as D-Bees
and supernatural creatures, can be found throughout the land. Dragons
are reportedly common to the wilderness forests that cover the land,
but I can not personally substantiate this rumor. I can tell you that like
the days of old, the land is a wilderness with little human life other
than trappers (wilderness scouts) and tiny settlements along the lakes.
   Old Detroit, once a manufacturing center of the American Empire,
lays in ruin. Only a few crumbling buildings still stand (the same is
true of Windsor, across the Detroit River). Four nexus points are located
in the old city limits, making the area a haven for monsters. However,
I have heard tell of excavations that have unearthed some fabulous finds
in the way of technology and literary artifacts. I've also heard rumors
that in the last decade, monsters from the rifts have claimed the site as
their own and are building a city in the old downtown area, over the
salt mines.
   Windsor (Canada, two miles directly across the river) is also a haven
for supernatural fiends, with three nexus points of its own.
   Ann Arbor, Michigan is about 50 miles west of Detroit and is a
small, but thriving community of magic practitioners and scholars,
known as "New Lazlo." The place was the site of a sprawling university
before the Time of Rifts and many marvellous books, recordings, and
artifacts have been uncovered from the ruins, including several works
by the illustrious Victor Lazlo. In practicality, New Lazlo is a town
that has grown from an archaeological outpost started by Lazlo, to the
east (Toronto, Canada). The town prospers with a mixed population of
humans and non-humans surrounded by friendly farm communities.
The population of about 40,000 is happy and consumed with the pursuits
of magic and knowledge.
   I see New Lazlo as a disaster waiting to happen. I suspect that the
Coalition is not yet aware of its existence. As we all know, the CS
views Lazlo as an enemy and has left it alone because they do not feel
powerful enough to wage a war through lands brimming with magic
energy, and because Lazlo is a safe 600 miles away. New Lazlo, on                      23. Wisconsin. The southern portion of Wisconsin, from Green

Dark Blue areas are areas known to be heavy with magic energy,
ley lines, and nexus points/rifts.
The two blue triangular areas are the infamous "Bermuda Triangle"
and a companion area off the coast of South America. Both are
dangerous regions known to be giant dimensional rifts.
Grey areas are the cold, icy regions of the arctic.
Green areas are forest or jungle.
Brown areas are grasslands and deserts.

   North America is mostly wilderness with the greatest human popu-
lation found in the Mid-West. The "Magic Zone" is the most powerful
region of mystic energy in the land of the old USA. It ranges from
St. Louis through the Ohio Valley.
  Canada is also a land of wilderness. The majority of its human
population is found in the east and mid-west. Alberta and Saskatche-
wan are laden with magic and rifts.
   Mexico is an unexplored area known to be the home of vampire
tribes. Rumor tells of an advance vampire culture with human cattle
and slaves somewhere near old Mexico City.
   South America is now known as the "Land of a Thousand Islands,"
because the Amazon River is bigger than ever and has divided the
land around it into hundreds of islands, large and small. Major areas
of magic are found in the Andes and a portion of Brazil in the Amazon
jungle.

Range: 60ft (18.3m)

Saving Throw: Special
P.P.E.: Seven
  This spell creates a net composed of magic fibers which will snare
1-6 human sized victims within a 10ft area. Normal weapons can not
cut through the net; only mega-damage weapons, magic weapons, and
magic can effect this net. Even then it requires a full two melee rounds
to cut or blast out (a dispel magic barriers will dispel it instantly).
Anyone caught in the magic net is helpless and unable to attack or
defend. The spell caster can cancel the net at any time.
  Savings Throw: Although there is no save vs magic, intended victims
can try to dodge being snared by rolling a 16 or higher.

The dangers of dealings
with the black market
  Characters should always remember that the black market, no matter
how friendly their contact may be, is a criminal organization whose
members include smugglers, thieves, spies, thugs, assassins, and all
sorts of scoundrels. Most of these guys are tough and mean. Many are
combat trained and augmented in some way. They will use and cheat
the characters whenever possible. Of course, good clients are treated
well until they become a liability or not so good clients.
   There is also the perpetual danger of being arrested by law officers
while involved in an illegal transaction with the black market. Other
problems include Coalition spies posing as black marketeers and paying
premium prices for inferior goods (actually black market items are
pretty good and reliable).

has been mechanically suppressed, but are still terribly loud (about
equal to 85 decibels) and gun operators must still wear protective
headgear to muffle the sound. Prolonged operation of a rail gun without
a sound suppressor will cause permanent damage to the ears and eventual
deafness. Many military rail gun operators have cybernetic sound filt-
ration systems installed.
  The size, weight, and kick of the massive gun is unavoidable and is
why the weapon is restricted to power armor, robots and vehicles. Rail
guns are generally two and three times larger than 20th Century heavy
machineguns and weigh around a hundred pounds, not including the
power pack and ammunition. When used as a machinegun, the person
transporting the rail gun must have a minimum strength (P.S.) of 22
and is often assigned to a two or three man team with a combined
strength of 42 or higher. One carries the tripod and huge case of ammun-
ition (sometimes on wheels), while the other carries the rail gun and
nuclear power pack.
   The nuclear power pack presents a danger to life from radiation leaks.
However, the power pack is well shielded and encased in a lightweight
mega-damage alloy (40 M.D.C.). Note that the power pack will not
explode if breached or even destroyed, but it will contaminate the area
with deadly radiation. A radiation alarm system sounds an alarm to
warn the operator of a leak.

The Northern
Gun Sky King
  The most famous and popular combat vehicle created by the kingdom
of Ishpeming (aka "The Northern Gun") is the heavy assault hover
vehicle called the Sky King. The vehicle is fast, tough and reliable.
Most importantly, it is brimming with weapons.

Cybernetic Augmentation Mechanisms
   Cybernetics for the purpose of augmentation are mechanisms that
have special and superhuman capabilities. They are designed to make
the human body better, stronger, and more alert. Augmentation implants
are usually mechanical and seldom utilize the melding of flesh and
machine that occurs in cybernetic bio-systems.

Amplified Hearing: A system of tiny sound amplifiers, microphones
  and receivers are built into the ear canal, enabling the character to
  hear almost inaudible sounds at 100 yards/meters away.
     At 75 feet (22.9 m), sounds as quiet as one decibel, softer than
  a whisper, can be heard.
     At 150 feet (45.8 m), sounds as quiet as 10 decibels, a whisper,
  can be heard clearly.
     At 360 feet (110 m), sounds in the normal conversation range of
  30 decibels can be heard as if the character was standing only a few
  feet away. This is the maximum range for eavesdropping on conver-
  sations; only sounds 70 decibels or louder can be accurately heard
  and location pinpointed from 500 to 1000 feet away (152.4 m to
  304.8 m).
     The amplified hearing also enables the character to accurately
  estimate the distance and location of the sound source, and recognize
  specific sounds and voices at a base skill of 35% plus 5% per level
  of experience. Bonuses: +1 to parry, +2 to dodge, +6 on initiative.

   The disadvantage, other than its more obvious nature, is that there
is no true sense of touch, only sensors designed to respond to heat and
pressure. The lack of touch can be emotionally and mentally debilitating.
However, the mechanical substitute is still a marvelous alternative to
no limb at all.

P.S. 10, P.P. 10; S.D.C. 35. Weight: 12 Ibs. Legs are the same, with
a maximum speed attribute of 10 and a S.D.C, of 50. Weight: 30 Ibs.
Skill penalty of - 15% due to lack of full articulation and no sense of
touch.
  Medical Statistics: If the appendage is subjected to minor damage
from a cut or burn, only surface blemishes and disfigurement of the
outer skin casing will result, but the mechanical functions are unim-
paired.
   Severe damage can snap the neural links (1-40% chance), transform-
ing the limb into an immobile paperweight attached to the body. To
avoid unnecessary stress to the connecting portion of the flesh and
blood body, the limb should be supported in a sling or brace. Unlike
the appendage with artificial skin, there is no flesh or fluids to decay
and poison the body. However, the following movement penalties apply
to immobile limbs. Hand/arm: -2 to strike, parry, dodge, and roll;
the person's balance is off even if the arm is not his main one. Foot/leg:
 -2 to strike, parry, and dodge, -2 on initiative, -3 to roll, no kick
attacks are possible without falling down and losing one attack; reduce
speed by half. Penalties are accumulative for each damaged limb.

Black Market
Cybernetics

   As a rule, any of the implants and cybernetics listed can be procured
through a black market cyber-doc clinic or body-chop-shop.
   The independent and caring black market cyber-doc is a rarity.
Cybernetics are simply too costly and dangerous to get unless one has
a huge support organization. Because cybernetic augmentation is so
desperately wanted by so many, the crime lords make a prosperous
living providing it.
   Black market cyber-docs are seldom nice guys. They are usually
self-serving criminals who work for a larger criminal organization.
They prey on the desperation of the sick, the terror of those hunted by
the Coalition, and the greed or power of the rich and corrupt to sell
their services. They are seldom caring doctors who seek to help the
unfortunate. Instead these scavengers are evil and corrupt men and
women who sell an illegal service for profit. Big Profit.

Black Market Prices
  Most cyber-docs, especially the criminals and chop-shop butchers,
won't care if a person is laying on his floor dying. It's pay the price
or leave. The price to high? Too bad. The alternative is to find
somebody else to do the job or live without the implant (if you can).
With luck, the individual will have enough credits for the job, or already
have something worthy of trade, like an old artifact, mega-damage
weapons or armor, information/secrets, or other commodity that the
mob will find valuable. Of course, there are other ways to pay for black
market surgery.

Climb Cord: Similar to the garrote wire, this is a ten foot (3.5 m)
   length of 500 Ib (225 kg) test cord, no thicker than string, that can
   be pulled out of an artificial wrist or arm. The cord is primarily
   used by thieves and city rats for prowling and climbing around. The
   length isn't long, but can be used to loop around projections to
   steady oneself or scale walls. A favorite ploy of thieves is to use
   the cord to avoid authorities by dangling, unseen, under a balcony
   or above, from a pipe.

Cyber-Armor: This is a unique lightweight armor that is grafted right
  to the skin. The armor plates are less than an eighth of an inch thick
   and form fitted around the contours of the body. Cyber-armor is
   only grafted to the chest, shoulders, shoulder blades, and thighs for
   two reasons. One, the body needs to breathe through skin pores and
   secondly, additional armor would greatly impair movement (reduce
   attacks, bonuses, and speed by half).
      The rest of the body is not protected. Consequently, this is one
   of the few mega-damage armors that has an armor rating; A.R. 16.
   A roll above the A.R. 16 means an unprotected portion of the body
   has been hit and damaged. The cyber-armor has a total M.D.C. of
   50. Adds 20 pounds (9 kg) to body weight. Cost: 55,000 credits.

   tools, electronic bugs or components/chips, and so on. The larger
   compartments are ideal for storing supplies, tools, hand-size equip-
   ment, hand grenades, and small handguns.
      Game Masters and players should use common sense regarding
   the number of compartments. Generally speaking, each leg and chest
   can accommodate two medium-size or one large compartment, or
   as many as six small each. The arms can only accommodate one
   small compartment on the forearm and upper arm, but only if no
   weapon systems are built into/on the arms.
   Cost: 1000 credits for each small, 2500 for each medium, and 4000
   for each large.
Head & Throat Features
Bionic Lung with Gas Filter & Oxygen Storage Cell: An artificial
    lung implanted to provide for the special needs of the borg. A
   chemical cell, controlled by microprocessors, stores oxygen from
   the character's normal breathing. Then, when oxygen is low, the
   oxygen is released back into the lungs. The net effect is to give the
   character the ability to go without breathing for up to two hours.
   Note that the character must breathe normally for about three hours
   to fully recharge the cell between uses. The lung also has a gas
   filtration system designed to filter most toxic gases out of the system
   before they can do damage. The filter is effective against all types
   of tear gas, smoke, and purely chemical fumes. There is a 94%
   likelihood that it will also work against nerve gases and poison gases.
   Cost: 250,000 credits.
Built-in Loudspeaker: The borg can amplify the loudness of his voice,
   like a bull horn, to about 80 decibels.
   Cost: 6,000 credits.
Built-in Radio Receiver & Transmitter Headjack: A fully operational
   radio is built inside the head. Channels are switched by working the
  jaw and transmissions are received directly in the ear identical to
   the cybernetic headjack. The borg can send transmissions by a mental
   command and quietly talking out loud. A microphone is built into
   the jaw.
   Range: 20 miles (32 km). Cost: 22,000; add 10,000 for scrambling
   radio messages and decoding.
Built-in Speech Translator: This head and ear unit works very similar
   to the portable unit. Several concealed speakers can be made to
   focus on one particular voice/person (range: 100 feet/30.5 m) and
   have his words instantly translated (only a three second delay). The
   translator is fluent in the nine or so major known languages and can
   be programmed, by a technician, to add six others.
      The audio translations are transmitted to the cybernetic ear/head-
  jack and is loud enough for only the borg to hear it. The system
   also has a limited recording capability. The borg can activate the
   recorder by a simple jaw movement. Maximum recording time is
   one hour and the recording disc can be re-used over again and again,
   with minimal audio distortion. The recording can be secretly played
  back in the ear of the borg or transmitted over the jaw radio or
   loudspeaker if available. Translations can also be transmitted over
   the loudspeaker.
   Cost: 11,000 credits.
Molecular Analyzer: This microchip based sensor is used for testing
  and analyzing impurities in the air. It can specifically identify any
  chemical, or strange and dangerous molecules, like the presence of
  gas, oil, pollution, or other chemicals in the air. Data can be trans-
  mitted as an audio report through one of the ear or computer implants.
  It does not enable one to track.
  Cost: 50,000 credits.
Modulating Voice Synthesizer: Enables the character to change/dis-
  guise his voice by altering tone, bass, pitch, etc. Can also speak in
  a sound frequency inaudible to normal humans, but audible to normal
