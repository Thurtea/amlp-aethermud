                          IDENTITY SYSTEM
===============================================================================

AetherMUD features a sophisticated identity and introduction system.

THE CONCEPT:
-----------
When you first encounter another character, you don't automatically know their
name. They appear as a stranger based on their race and appearance:
  "a tall human warrior"
  "a great horned dragon"
  "a mysterious elf"

INTRODUCING YOURSELF:
--------------------
  introduce <name>
  
Tell others your name. Anyone in the room will remember it for the session.

Example:
  > introduce Raven
  You introduce yourself as Raven.
  (Others see: "The tall human warrior introduces themselves as Raven.")

REMEMBERING PEOPLE:
------------------
  remember <person>
  
Permanently remember someone's identity across sessions. This represents your
character forming a memory of them.

Example:
  > remember Raven
  You will remember Raven from now on.

FORGETTING PEOPLE:
-----------------
  forget <person>
  
Forget someone's identity. They'll appear as a stranger again.

Example:
  > forget Raven
  You forget who Raven is.

HOW IT WORKS IN GAMEPLAY:
-------------------------

STRANGERS:
  Before introduction, you see:
  "A tall human warrior is standing here."
  
AFTER INTRODUCTION:
  "Raven the human warrior is standing here."
  
AFTER REMEMBERING:
  Even after logout/login, you'll recognize them as Raven.

PERSISTENCE:
-----------
- Session introductions: Last until you logout
- Remembered names: Persist forever (saved to your character)
- Automatic sync: On login, all remembered names are activated

IDENTITY IN COMMANDS:
--------------------
Once introduced, you can use their name in commands:
  > look Raven
  > give sword Raven
  > attack Raven
  > whisper Raven hello

Before introduction, you must use their description:
  > look human
  > give sword warrior

OBSERVER MESSAGES:
-----------------
When you perform actions, others see different messages based on whether
they know you:

Strangers see:
  "A tall human warrior picks up a sword."
  
People who know you see:
  "Raven picks up a sword."

ACTIONS AFFECTED:
----------------
The identity system affects these actions:
- Equipment: wear, wield, remove, unwield
- Objects: get, drop, give, put
- Movement: arriving/departing rooms
- Communication: say, whisper
- Combat: attack, flee
- Magic: casting spells
- Special abilities: metamorph (dragon shapeshift)

DISGUISES:
---------
Some abilities allow identity masking:
- Metamorph (Great Horned Dragon racial ability)
- Disguise skill
- Illusion magic
- Mind wipe psionics

ROLEPLAYING:
-----------
The identity system encourages realistic roleplay:
- Introduce yourself in taverns
- Form lasting relationships
- Create your reputation
- Maintain disguises when needed
- Recognize enemies on sight

TIPS:
----
1. Introduce yourself when entering groups
2. Remember allies and guild members
3. Use 'who' command to see online names
4. Strangers can still attack you!
5. Your surname is separate (help surname)
