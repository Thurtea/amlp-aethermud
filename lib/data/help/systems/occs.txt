OCCS - List available Occupational Character Classes

Usage:
  occs       Show which O.C.C.s are available for your race

Description:
  Displays the list of Occupational Character Classes (O.C.C.s)
  that your current race/R.C.C. is eligible to select.

  Not all races may choose an O.C.C. Some races (such as dragons,
  psi-stalkers, and Dog Boys) are defined entirely by their R.C.C.
  and do not take a separate O.C.C.

  O.C.C. selection is handled by an RP-Wizard during character setup.
  Once applied, your O.C.C. grants you starting skills and special
  abilities appropriate to your class.
