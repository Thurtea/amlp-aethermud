DEATH SYSTEM

Characters begin with 5 lives. When HP reaches 0:
  - You lose 1 life
  - You may gain a scar (visible in 'score')
  - You respawn at the starting area
  - Your stats and equipment are preserved

At 0 lives remaining, the character is permanently dead.

AVOIDING DEATH
  - Use 'wimpy <percent>' to auto-flee at low HP
  - Use 'flee' to attempt escape from combat
  - Rest between fights to regenerate HP
  - Use healing items or psionic healing
