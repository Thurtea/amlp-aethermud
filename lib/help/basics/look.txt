INTRODUCTION SYSTEM
  If you haven't been introduced to a player, you see them
  by race (e.g. "a human") rather than by name. Looking at
  an unintroduced player shows their race and a health hint
  but not their name.

  Use 'introduce' to share your identity with others.

HEALTH HINTS
  When looking at another player, you'll see a health status:
    "in good health"        90-100% HP
    "a bit roughed up"      50-89% HP
    "seriously wounded"      25-49% HP
    "barely standing"       under 25% HP
