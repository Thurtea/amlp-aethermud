FALCONRY - Training and Commanding Birds of Prey
=================================================

Falconry is a wilderness skill available to Wilderness Scouts and
Nomads. It governs how well your hawk or falcon obeys voice commands.

SKILL PERCENTAGES:
  Base: 35% (+5% per level)
  Synergy bonuses: Land Navigation (+5%), Wilderness Survival (+5%)
  Maximum: 98%

PASSIVE BONUS:
  When Falconry >= 50%, you gain +2 Perception in outdoor environments.

OBEDIENCE:
  When you issue a voice command (see below), your hawk rolls against
  your Falconry percentage. If the roll fails, the hawk ignores you.
  Higher skill = more reliable hawk.

VOICE COMMANDS:
  Commands are issued using the SAY command:
    say <birdname> <command> [arguments]

  Available commands:
    follow          -- Hawk follows you between rooms
    stay            -- Hawk stays in its current room
    come            -- Hawk returns to your room
    return          -- Alias for come
    perch           -- Hawk lands on your arm/shoulder
    fly             -- Hawk takes flight (required for hunt/scout)
    scout <dir>     -- Hawk flies to adjacent room and reports back
    attack <target> -- Hawk attacks a target in your room
    hunt            -- Hawk searches for prey (must be flying)
    eat [corpse]    -- Hawk feeds on a corpse (restores its HP)

SCOUT REPORT:
  When you order your hawk to scout a direction, it flies ahead and
  returns with a report showing:
    - Room name in that direction
    - Number of hostile creatures spotted
    - Number of non-hostile presences

HAWK TIERS:
  Level 3 -- Hawk        (obtained: 10 E-Clips)
  Level 5 -- Master Hawk (obtained: TX-500 Laser Rifle)
  Level 7 -- Falcon      (obtained: Coalition States Uniform)

  Higher-tier birds have better stats, more attacks, and improved
  hunting success.

HATCHING:
  Eggs must be hatched before use. Type 'hatch egg' while holding
  a hawk egg. Success chance is based on your Falconry skill.
  A failed hatch destroys the egg.

OBTAINING HAWKS:
  Trade items with Aldric at the New Camelot Falconer shop.
  Type 'list' inside the shop to see current trade offers.
