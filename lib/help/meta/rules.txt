AETHERMUD RULES

1. RESPECT       Treat all players with respect. No harassment,
                 hate speech, or personal attacks.

2. ROLEPLAY      This is an RP-encouraged MUD. Stay in character
                 when possible. Use 'ooc' for out-of-character talk.

3. NO CHEATING   Do not exploit bugs. Report them to wizards.
                 Using exploits may result in character deletion.

4. PVP           Player-vs-player combat requires mutual consent
                 unless in designated PVP zones.

5. NAMES         Choose appropriate character names. No offensive
                 names, real-world references, or joke names.

6. MULTIPLAY     One character per player. Do not use multiple
                 connections simultaneously.

7. WIZARDS       Wizard commands are for administration only.
                 Abuse of wizard powers will result in demotion.

Violations may result in warnings, temporary bans, or
permanent removal at admin discretion.
