PETS - Companion Animals
========================

Pets are companion animals that follow and obey their owner.
They use voice commands (the SAY command) to receive orders.

CURRENT PETS:
  Hawk / Master Hawk / Falcon
    Obtained from the New Camelot falconer shop via barter.
    Requires: Falconry skill (Wilderness Scout, Nomad OCCs)

VOICE COMMANDS:
  Issue commands by saying your pet's name followed by the command:
    say <petname> <command> [arguments]

  Universal commands:
    follow   -- Pet follows you between rooms
    stay     -- Pet stays put
    come     -- Pet returns to your room
    return   -- Same as come

  Hawk/Falcon commands:
    perch           -- Bird perches on your arm
    fly             -- Bird takes flight
    scout <dir>     -- Bird scouts an adjacent room and reports
    attack <target> -- Bird attacks a target
    hunt            -- Bird hunts for prey (must be flying)
    eat [corpse]    -- Bird feeds (restores HP)

OBEDIENCE:
  Each command triggers an obedience check against your relevant
  companion skill (Falconry for hawks). If the check fails, the
  pet ignores the command. Higher skill = more reliable pet.

OBTAINING PETS:
  Hawks:   Trade with Aldric at the New Camelot Falconer
           Type 'help falconer' for trade details

HATCHING:
  Some pets start as eggs. Use 'hatch egg' to hatch them.
  Success depends on your skill. Failed hatches destroy the egg.
