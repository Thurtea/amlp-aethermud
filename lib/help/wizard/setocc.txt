Wizards use this command to assign an Occupational Character Class
to a player. Players request OCCs via tell:
  Player: tell Thurtea I would like the O.C.C. Cyber-Knight

  setocc <player> <occ> confirm   (bypass safety check)
  setocc reset <player>           (reset OCC to Pending)
  setocc list                     (show all available OCCs)

EXAMPLES
  setocc Splynncryth cyber_knight
  setocc Arismal ley_line_walker
  setocc DragonPlayer necromancer

SAFETY CHECKS
  The 'confirm' flag is required when:
  - Player already has an OCC (replacement)
  - Assigning a major OCC: Cosmo-Knight, Full Conversion Borg,
    Glitter Boy Pilot, Mind Melter, Necromancer, Sunaj Assassin

RESET
  setocc reset <player>  - Clears OCC to "Pending" and removes
  primary skills. Player must request a new OCC.

NOTES
  - RCC races (Dragons) already have a racial class
  - RCC characters can optionally take an OCC for extra abilities
  - Sunaj Assassin requires Atlantean race + Clan Aerihman
  - All OCC assignments are logged to /log/wizard/occ_assignments.log
