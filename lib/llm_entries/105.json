Furthermore, the psychic\n   can go without food or water for up to three weeks, if necessary,\n   without ill effect.

Other Psionic Powers: Choose six psi-powers from the Sensitive\n   category of powers.\n8. Psionic empathy with animals. Psi-stalkers automatically have\n   an affinity with animals of all kinds. Domesticated animals will\n   always take an immediate liking to a stalker and will do their best\n   to please him; +15% bonus to ride a horse and work with all\n   domestic animals.\n      Wild animals, with the exception of felines and mutant and alien\n   predators, will react to the stalker as if he was a fellow woodland\n   creature, allowing him to walk among them without fear. This\n   ability enables psi-stalkers to operate in the wild without causing\n   animals to react to their presence; birds do not fly away, animals\n   do not run, and therefore do not indicate the approach of an intruder.\n   Even watchdogs will not sound a bark of alarm at the presence of\n   a stalker.\n      Felines and mutant and alien predatory animals seem to see the\n   psi-stalker as a fellow hunter and a danger. Wild cats and mutants\n   will frequently select a psi-stalker as their first target in an attack\n   and will not positively respond to the character at all.\n      NOTE: This affinity with animals means that the character will\n   hunt and eat meat only for food, never for pleasure, and feels\n   sadness whenever he sees an animal in distress.",
