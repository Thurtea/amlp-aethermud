  "raw_snippet": "230 Amplified Hearing: A system of tiny sound amplifiers, microphones and receivers are built into the ear canal, enabling the character to hear almost inaudible sounds at 100 yards/meters away. At 75 feet (22.9 m), sounds as quiet as one decibel, softer than a whisper, can be heard. At 150 feet (45.8 m), sounds as quiet as 10 decibels, a whisper, can be heard clearly. At 360 feet (110 m), sounds in the normal conversation range of 30 decibels can be heard as if the character was standing only a few feet away. This is the maximum range for eavesdropping on conver- sations; only sounds 70 decibels or louder can be accurately heard and location pinpointed from 500 to 1000 feet away (152.4 m to 304.8 m). The amplified hearing also enables the character to accurately estimate the distance…",
