The larger compartments are ideal for storing supplies, tools, hand-size equip- ment, hand grenades, and small handguns. Game Masters and players should use common sense regarding the number of compartments. Generally speaking, each leg and chest can accommodate two medium-size or one large compartment, or as many as six small each. The arms can only accommodate one small compartment on the forearm and upper arm, but only if no weapon systems are built into/on the arms.
