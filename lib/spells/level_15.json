      "description": "The dimensional portal invocation opens a two-way door to another dimension. The mage can open a door to a specific world or randomly. This is the only way a greater being can enter into our dimension. Once the dimensional portal closes, the only way back in or out is to open another portal. One of the real dangers of using this magic is that some thing unwanted always slips through.",
