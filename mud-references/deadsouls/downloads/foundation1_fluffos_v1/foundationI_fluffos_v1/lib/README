		      Foundation I for MudOS v21
		       A minimalist LPC Library
			 Release 2 April 1995

This LPC library is designed very much for people who know what they
are doing.  Unlike Nightmare, it does not come with any configuration
script to get you started, a combat system for a fantasy MUD, or a
starter area.  It has none of the features which makes Nightmare and
easy library to through up a MUD quickly with.

Instead the theory behind the Foundation LPC Library is to give the
developer a solid design base from which to build a specific MUD
implementation without the baggage of extra unwanted features that may
be hard to remove you might get with a more developed library.

You will notice that the documentation is old.  I must apologize for
that.  The intention is to have all Nightmare references removed,
solidify the design base, and customize the documentation for
Foundation II, which is due May 15.  For now, understand there are
irrelevant and outdated documents in many cases in /doc.  But most of
the docs still are relevant and do hold true.

When compiling the driver, be sure to use the options.h included with
the Foundation I package, not the standard MudOS options.h.  If you
get the driver + Foundation package, this will already be set up for
you.  Otherwise, just copy the Foundation options.h over to your
driver source directory.  You might need to customize a few things for
your machine's needs, but the library specific options are all set for
you.
