Nightmare Mudlib SimulEfun: alignment_string()

string alignment_string(int|object val);

DESCRIPTION
Returns a string which describes the alignment of a player.  This
thing has no place being a SimulEfun, but, hey, it is.  You can pass
either an object which is a player or monster, or pass an int
representing an alignment value and get an alignment description
returned.

EXAMPLES
alignment_string(this_player()) might return "nice"
alignment_string(1) would return "neutral"
