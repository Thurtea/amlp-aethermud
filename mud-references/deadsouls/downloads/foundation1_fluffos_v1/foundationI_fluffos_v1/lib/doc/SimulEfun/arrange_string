Nightmare Mudlib SimulEfun: arrange_string()

string arrange_string(string, int);

DESCRIPTION
The second argument to this SimulEfun is a string length to which a string
should be arranged.  If the first argument is longer than the specified
length, then all remaining characters are chopped off.  If it is shorter,
then the remaining characters will be filled with spaces.

EXAMPLES
arrange_string("This is a long string.", 7) returns "This is"
arrange_string("short", 15) returns "short          "

NOTE
This function strips colours!
Also, use sprintf() in the mudlib.  This is only meant to keep cres
from having to deal with the complexities of sprintf().
