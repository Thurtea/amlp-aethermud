Ok, if your driver crashes, and you want to be helpful, here's what you do:

1. recompile the driver with the -g flag.  Turning off optimization
   is a good idea too.
2. go to your bin dir and type 'gdb driver' where driver is the name of your
   driver executable
3. It should startup, etc.  When it's ready, type 'run config.foo' or
   whatever you normally do to run the driver, with 'run' instead of the
   driver executable name.
4. Wait for the driver to crash (cause it to crash if you know how)
5. gdb should give you a prompt again.  type 'where'
6. Post the output of the where command along with anything you know about
   where/how/why the driver crashed on the MudOS bug report board.

If you actually get a traceback, it makes crashes somewhere between 10-100x
easier to fix.
