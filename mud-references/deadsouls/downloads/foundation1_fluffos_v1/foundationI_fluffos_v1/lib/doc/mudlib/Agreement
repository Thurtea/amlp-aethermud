			Foundation I-b1 Mudlib
		   for the MudOS v20.* Driver betas

The Foundation Mudlib evolves directly from the Nightmare 3.3 Mudlib.
It has the security and basic design of the Nightmare Mudlib with none
of the features.  Coming from the Nightmare mudlib like it does, it
therefore owes a lot to Nightmare's history.

This document serves as the liscensing agreement between those credited
in the credits document and any user of Foundation Mudlib, in whole or
in part.  Use of the Foundation Mudlib is considered consent to
the terms contained in this document.  There are 3 terms: 
  1) The Foundation Mudlib, neither in whole nor in part, may ever be
     used for profit.  Access to any mud making use of the Foundation Mudlib
     may only be restricted based on security reasons or reasons of network
     limitations. Specifically, access may not be restricted in order to
     charge access tolls.
  2) This document must be retained with any copy of the Foundation Mudlib
     in the /doc/mudlib directory with the mudlib credits.
  3) You must keep in tact all headers which express authorship of files from
     this mudlib.

The Foundation Mudlib, true to its name, is designed to be a basis for
mudlib development.  It is not a complete, ready to play mudlib.
Therefore, in the course of building your mud, you are likely to make
many additions to the mudlib.  As long as the core of the mudlib is
Foundation, it is expected that you will properly credit it in name
and spirit.
