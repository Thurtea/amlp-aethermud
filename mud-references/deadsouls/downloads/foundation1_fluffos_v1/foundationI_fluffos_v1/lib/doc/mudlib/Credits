	   The Foundation I Mudlib for the MudOS v21 Driver
			   List of Credits

Foundation I is based directly upon the code in the Nightmare 3.3
Mudlib.  In turn, many command files from Nightmare 3.3 come from the
TMI, TMI-2, and Discworld mudlibs.  This file attempts to credit
anyone who has contributed.  Please let me know if I have missed
anyone.

Primary Credit for Foundation I:
Descartes, Hanse, Pallando, Valodin

Other bits of code come from the following sources:
Archimedes, Beek, Brian. Buddha, Gregon, Huthar, Jubal, Kalinash, Pinkfish,
Plura, Sulam, Truilkan
