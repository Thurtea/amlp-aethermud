The directory structure of the Foundation I Mudlib is designed to be
as intuitive as possible following the dual needs of security and
functionality.  The directory structure is a direct reflection of the
basic design behind the Foundation I Mudlib.

The directory structure of the mudlib is divided up into two
distinctions:

	secure directories (sub-dirs of /secure)
	non-secure directories (all other dirs)

To understand this distinction fully, you need to understand better
the Foundation I Mudlib security system.  To put it short, no object
outside of /secure should ever have write access to /secure.  If they
do, you have a security hole.

The directory structure looks like this:

/cmds
Commands which need no special access.  You can feel more free to give
out access to people lower down the security ladder to this directory,
since it cannot be used to compromise MUD security.

/daemon
Non-secure daemons.  Same deal as with /cmds regarding security.

/doc
Documentation

/domains
Domains of the mud.  Areas which link creator realms.

/ftp
You hook up the ftp daemon available at the same site as the mudlib here

/include
Non-secure include files.

/log
Logging is done to this directory

/news
All your news files are located here

/realms
Cre home directories.

/secure
The secure directory

/std
Inheritable mudlib objects

/tmp
An open directory to which everyone has write access
