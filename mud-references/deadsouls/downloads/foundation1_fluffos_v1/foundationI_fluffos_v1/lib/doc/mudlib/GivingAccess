		   Giving Access with Foundation I

There are 3 key files for mudlib access with Foundation I.  Primarily,
there is /secure/cfg/groups.cfg.  You specify groups of people who
need common access in that file.

The second file is /secure/cfg/read.cfg
Only define this for RESTRICTED directories.  If everyone should be
allowed to read a directory, you do not need to put it in.  Access
defaults to global read.  If you want to restrict a directory,
restrict it to those privs strings which from groups.cfg and privs.h
which should have read access to the directory.  Everyone else will be
denied.

The third file is /secure/cfg/write.cfg
If a directory is NOT defined in this file, it is fully protected.
SECURE privs ALWAYS have access to any directory.  As with read,
specify groups and privs which are allowed to have access to the
directory in question.

NOTES:
1) Files and directories underneath a directory a denoted by a
terminating /.  The directory itself is denoted without a temrinating
/.  Thus:

/secure specifies access ONLY for operations on /secure, not on any of
the files or directories under it

/secure/ specifies access for all the files and directories which fall
under /secure, but NOT /secure itself.

2) You can specify access to specific files.  Entries need not be
directories.
