The Foundation I LPC Library

Released 2 April 1995, Copyright applies (/doc/mudlib/Agreement)

NOTE: This is a very basic lib, for LPC experts.
See http://lpmuds.net/downloads.html for other available libs.

IMPORTANT: This lib gives full read/write creator access to
any file to anyone who logs on. Your first project will probably
need to be developing a security system.
