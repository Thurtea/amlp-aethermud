__INIT(4)                Driver Applies                 __INIT(4)

NAME
     __INIT - obsolete apply

SYNOPSIS
     __INIT( void );

DESCRIPTION
     This function used to be  called  in  objects  right  before
     create.   global  variable  initialization is now handled by
     another function that cannot be interfered with, so this  is
     no longer called.
