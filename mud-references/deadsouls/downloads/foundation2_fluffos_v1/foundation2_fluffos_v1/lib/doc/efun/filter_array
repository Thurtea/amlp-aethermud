NAME
     filter_array() - return a selective sub-array

SYNOPSIS
     mixed *filter_array( mixed *arr, string fun, object ob,
                          mixed extra, ... );
     mixed *filter_array( mixed *arr, function f, mixed extra, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     filter_array() returns an array holding the items  of  <arr>
     which passed sucessfully through the function <fun> found in
     object <ob>.  The function <fun> is called for each  element
     in <arr> with that element as parameter.  The second parame-
     ter <extra> and following parameters are sent in  each  call
     if  given.   An  object is considered to have passed sucess-
     fully through <fun> (and hence is  included  in  the  return
     array)  if  <fun>  returns  1.   If  f  is passed it is used
     instead of ob->fun().  If <arr> is not an array, then 0 will
     be returned.
