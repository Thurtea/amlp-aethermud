without all the collaboration which has made the LPMud community what
it is.  This documents seeks to give credit to those who have written
code appearing in the Foundation II LPC Library as well as to
acknowledge the siginificant contributions of others over the history
of this mudlib, going back to TMI-1 and mudlib.n.  It should be noted
that regardless of authorship, all code in the Foundation II LPC
Library is subject to the copyright and agreement stated in the
