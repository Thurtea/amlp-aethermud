		    The Foundation II LPC Library
	       The History of the Foundation LPC Lbrary
		 written by Descartes of Borg 950505

The Foundation LPC Library is a relatively new library of LPC objects.
Its first incarnation was a trimmed down version of the Nightmare 3.3
LPC Library.  The Foundation I-b was made available in the fall of
1994.  The full first release was later released April 1995.

Foundation II (May 1995)  was developed in parallel with Nightmare IV.
It uses the same base design as well security system and basic simul
efuns used by the Nightmare IV LPC Library.  At that point, however,
the two libraries diverge.  No game-related functionality exists in
the Foundation II LPC Library.  Instead, the library consists of a
minimum set of base classes a developer will need to develop most any
use of an LPMud.
